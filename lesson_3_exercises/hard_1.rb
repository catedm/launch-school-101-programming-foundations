# Question 1
# What do you expect to happen when the greeting
# variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?

if false
  greeting = “hello world”
end

greeting

# greeting will return nil


# Question 2
# What is the result of the last line in the code below?

greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings

# => the output is {:a=>"hi there"}


# Question 3
# In other exercises we have looked at how the scope of variables affects
# the modification of one "layer" when they are passed to another.

# To drive home the salient aspects of variable scope and modification
# of one scope by another, consider the following similar sets of code.

# What will be printed by each of these code groups?

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = two
  two = three
  three = one
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}" # => "one is one"
puts "two is: #{two}" # => "two is two"
puts "three is: #{three}" # => "three is three"

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = "two"
  two = "three"
  three = "one"
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}" # => "one is one"
puts "two is: #{two}" # => "two is two"
puts "three is: #{three}" # => "three is three"

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one.gsub!("one","two")
  two.gsub!("two","three")
  three.gsub!("three","one")
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}" # => "one is two"
puts "two is: #{two}" # => "two is three"
puts "three is: #{three}" # => "three is one"


# Question 4
# A UUID is a type of identifier often used as a way to
# uniquely identify items...which may not all be created by
# the same system. That is, without any form of synchronization,
# two or more separate computer systems can create new items
# and label them with a UUID with no significant chance of
# stepping on each other's toes.

# It accomplishes this feat through massive randomization.
# The number of possible UUID values is approximately 3.4 X 10E38.

# Each UUID consists of 32 hexadecimal characters, and is
# typically broken into 5 sections like this 8-4-4-4-12 and represented as a string.

# It looks like this: "f65c57f6-a6aa-17a8-faa1-a67f2dc9fa91"

# Write a method that returns one UUID when called with no parameters.

def generate_uuid
  characters = []
  (0..9).each { |digit| characters << digit.to_s }
  ('a'..'f').each { |digit| characters << digit.to_s}

  uuid = ""
  sections = [8, 4, 4, 4, 12]
  sections.each_with_index do |section, index|
    section.times { uuid += characters.sample }
    uuid += '-' unless index >= section.size - 1
  end

    uuid
end


# Question 5
# Ben was tasked to write a simple ruby method to determine if
# an input string is an IP address representing dot-separated numbers.
# e.g. "10.4.5.11". He is not familiar with regular expressions.
# Alyssa supplied Ben with a method called is_an_ip_number? that
# determines if a string is a valid ip address number and asked
# Ben to use it.

def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    break unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end
  return true
end

# Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and says "It's a good start, but you
# missed a few things. You're not returning a false condition,
# and you're not handling the case that there are more or fewer
# than 4 components to the IP address (e.g. "4.5.5" or "1.2.3.4.5"
# should be invalid)."

# Help Ben fix his code.

def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  return false unless dot_separated_words.size == 4

  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    return false unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end

  true
end
