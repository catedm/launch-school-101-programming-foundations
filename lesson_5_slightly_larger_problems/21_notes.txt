- 52 card deck:
  - 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades)
  - 13 values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, ace)

- Goal:
  - get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If you go over, you "bust" and lose.

- Setup:
  - game consists of a "dealer" and a "player"
  - Both are initially dealt 2 cards
  - "Player" can see their 2 cards, but can only see one of the dealer's cards

- Card values:
  - 2 thru 10 are worth their face value
  - jack, queen and king are each worth 10

- Ace value:
  - ace can be worth 1 or 11
    - ace's value is determined each time a new card is drawn from the deck
      - ex: if the hand contains a 2, an ace, and a 5, then the total value of the hand is 18.
        - in this case the ace is worth 11 because the sum of the hand (2 + 11 + 5) doesn't exceed 21
        - another card is drawn and it happens to be an ace
        - program will have to determine the value of both aces
          - if the sum of the hand (2 + 11 + 5 + 11) exceeds 21 then one of the aces must be worth 1
            - one of the aces being worth 1 brings the total of the hand to 19
            - think about a CASE STATEMENT here

- Player Turn:
  - player goes first, and can decide to either "hit" or "stay"
  - a "hit" means the player will ask for another card
    - remember if the total exceeds 21, the player "busts" and loses
    - if the player "busts" the game is over and the dealer won

- Dealer Turn:
  - when the player "stays" its the dealers turn
  - the dealer will "hit" until the total is at least 17

- Comparing Cards:
  - when both the player and the dealer stay, compare the total value of the cards and see who has the highest value
